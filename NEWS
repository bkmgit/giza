v1.4.0
------
- added mp4 driver, can simply give "file.mp4" as the device to generate mp4 file
- can amend flags to ffmpeg using GIZA_FFMPEG_FLAGS environment variable
- automated cleanup of temporary .png files used to make the movie

v1.3.2
------

v1.3.0
------
- new library functions giza_set_motion_callback and giza_end_motion_callback
